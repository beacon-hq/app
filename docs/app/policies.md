# Policies

The Policies section manages access control, permissions, and governance rules for feature flags, applications, and user interactions within the Beacon system.

## Overview

Policies define who can access what resources and what actions they can perform. They provide fine-grained control over feature flag management, application access, and system administration, ensuring security and compliance across the organization.
